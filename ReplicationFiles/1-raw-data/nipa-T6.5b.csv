The number of full-time equivalent employees in each industry is the product of the total number of employees and the ratio of average weekly hours per employee for all employees to the average weekly hours per employee on full-time schedules."
"2. Beginning with 1987, reflects the reclassification of air couriers from trucking and warehousing to transportation by air."
"3. Includes Coast Guard."
"Note. Estimates in this table are based on the 1972 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)."
